# Readme
This repository provides examples on how to use backup/restore tool for
Greenplum.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kongyew/greenplum-backup.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kongyew/greenplum-backup)

# Introduction
Back up your entire cluster periodically to minimize data inconsistency when a restore is required.

# Types of backup:
The following backup types are available for Greenplum database.

* Full
* Incremental

# Use Case:
1. [Learn how to perform full backup and restore to  file system](#usecase1/README.MD)
2. [Learn how to perform full backup and restore to  S3](#usecase1/README.MD)
3. [Learn how to perform incremental backup](#usecase2/README.MD)
4. [Learn how to use GPDB plugin storage](#usecase3/README.MD)
5. [How to copy your database to another cluster](#usecase4/README.MD)

# How to use:
1. [Learn how to use gpbackup and gprestore]
2. [Learn how to use gpcrondump]


## Use gpbackup and gprestore
Now, you can run parallel backup solution for Greenplum. gpbackup and gprestore are designed to improve the performance, functionality, and reliability of backups as compared to gpcrondump and gpdbrestore.

### gpbackup
gpbackup utilizes ACCESS SHARE locks at the individual table level, instead of EXCLUSIVE locks on the pg_class catalog table.

 This enables you to execute DML statements during the backup, such as CREATE, ALTER, DROP, and TRUNCATE operations, as long as those operations do not target the current backup set.

 Therefore, you can quickly run parallel backup to ensure your data is safely protected.
